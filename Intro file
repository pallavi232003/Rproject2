E-commerce Sales Analysis

Goal:
The project aimed to analyze sales data to uncover purchase trends, customer behavior, and product performance. This helped suggest strategies to boost sales and optimize inventory.

Datasets & Tools:

Dataset: Synthetic or company-provided sales transaction data (order details, customer data, product categories).

Tools:

Python (Pandas, Seaborn) for EDA.

Power BI/Tableau for interactive dashboards.

SQL for querying large data subsets.

Key Insight/Deliverable:
The analysis revealed that most sales peaked during festival seasons, with electronics and apparel being top-performing categories. Loyal customers (repeat buyers) contributed to 40% of total revenue. I delivered a dashboard summarizing KPIs like sales by region, category performance, and customer lifetime value (CLV), along with actionable recommendations for targeted marketing.
